<div class="w3-container w3-large w3-text-grey">
  <p class="">My name is Jacob Schwab and as of right now I really have a broad idea of what I want to do in college. I have looked at all forms of engineering sciences and even some geological and chemical subjects.</p>
  <p class="">For me engineering was a gift that I recieved at an early age. I was always playing with blocks or thinking of interesting concepts and projects but now I not only do that but take part in community service projects. My favorite place to do service is Minnie's Food Pantry. It has an amazing atmosphere and while there I feel as though I can do anything and I know that everything I do complete there will help someone no matter what I do.</p>

  <p class="">Although I am mainly engineering minded and really spend most of my time indoors my favorite memory has to be my boy scout Philmont Trip in the summer of 2015. It was hard and sure sometimes I wish I was at home relaxing but in the end by pushing through the 70+ miles of hiking I began to see a different side of me that I had never seen before. Our trek group was amazing and we had a lot of fun as I really got to know the people better and everyone got to see a different side of each other that wasn't always available to see during troop activities or meetings.</p>
