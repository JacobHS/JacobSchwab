  <p class="">In FFYR we had to defend or battle for our side of a civil court case. The cases were all civil cases but we had to research and come up with our side of the case to defend our group.</p>
  <p class="">For our case we were defending a Mayor who was seen as corrupt and he was not releasing document to part of the department chair group so they then brought him to civil court.</p>

<div class="w3-half w3-container w3-large w3-text-grey">
 <p class="">Many parts of the project required us to contact outside sources for past information and since our case was based in New York City we had to contact them in order to see if they had any additional information in their archives.</p>
 <p class="">The outcome of the case was that the defendant was not guilty of withholding records from the public and we won the case. </p>

    <p class="w3-large w3-text-grey">For this project we had to do an art piece on another group's court case and had to choose a side. The case I had to do my art piece on was on lead paint and so I showed a childs hand going into some spilled paint and a catchy slogan that shows how they should be more careful.</p>

      <p class="w3-large w3-text-grey">This piece was a simple but yet extravagant piece. We had to interview someone and create an art piece that displayed what they told you so since my person liked classic videogames and music I created a classic yet modern controller. I shows not only the classic feel but it also show the more modernistic feel that he really liked.</p>
